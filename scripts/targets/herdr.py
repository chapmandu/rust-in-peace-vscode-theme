"""herdr theme config fragment.

Recolours herdr's catppuccin base theme (catppuccin-latte for the light
flavor) to the album palette through the [theme.custom] override tokens (a
Catppuccin-flavoured vocabulary); any token not overridden falls through to
the base. The primary accent is the cover's electric tube blue, matching the
Zellij tuning, and panel_bg sits sunken below content as VS Code's chrome
does.

Design: one Token table maps herdr's vocabulary onto palette paths, each with
an inline note that lands in the generated file as a comment.
