"""Entry point: build the downstream editor/terminal themes into ports/.

Run as `python -m scripts.build_ports` (wrapped by `just build-ports`,
and run by `just build`). Each Target pairs an output directory/extension with a
generator from scripts/targets/, rendered once per flavor (core, the lighter
variants, Dawn Patrol) so every target ships the same four themes as the VS
Code build. Zed is the one exception: its format is a theme family, so all
four flavors land in a single JSON.

Unlike dist/, the ports/ outputs are committed — users copy them straight
from the repo — so CI rebuilds them and fails if they've gone stale relative
to the palettes.
